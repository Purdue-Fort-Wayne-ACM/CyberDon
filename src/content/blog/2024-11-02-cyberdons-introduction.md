description: The first post of the CyberDons blog!

Hey all! This is the first official post of the ACM CyberDons blog!!! The goal of this post is to introduce the blog, chat about why we're introducing it, and our hopes for the blog's future.

# Welcome To CyberDons

The PFW ACM has been attempting to create more space for student expression and more opportunities to show off our students' projects. CyberDons is yet another avenue we're exploring to achieve that.

This is a blog dedicated to the exploration and explanation of cybersecurity topics, culture, and news. We're going to be gradually opening up who contributes to the blog posts and infrastructure over the remainder of the year. For now, we're looking forward to a chance to engage with you all!

# Why a blog?

The choice to make a blog specifically was driven by a number of factors.

First, blogs have a relaxed nature and feel. People feel more at ease working on a blog format than say an official club page, article, or paper format. This gives people a chance to explore writing for an audience with less stress. I also believe that a more relaxed format gives people more willingness to write about topics they're unsure will Garner interest.

Second blogs build awareness. Having club work and posts _out there_ where they can be easily seen and accessed, rather than just existing in our meetings, or on our discord, gives people something to engage with. We can emphasize partnerships, reach a wider audience, and establish a name for our chapter.

Finally it's fun! I wanted to make it so I did, and sometimes that's the best reason~
